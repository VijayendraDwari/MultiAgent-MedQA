# MultiAgent-MedQA
This project implements a Multi-Agent Medical QA System designed to handle text-based medical queries and analyze X-ray images to provide accurate and detailed insights. The system consists of two specialized agents.

## Overview
MultiAgent-MedQA is a cutting-edge system designed to address two crucial aspects of medical inquiry: processing text-based medical questions and analyzing X-ray images to provide accurate, detailed insights. This project leverages the power of multiple specialized agents to deliver robust responses to varied medical queries.

## Architecture

## Features
- **Dual-Agent Architecture:**  
  - *Text QA Agent:* Handles natural language medical questions and provides evidence-based responses.
  - *X-Ray Analysis Agent:* Processes and analyzes X-ray images to assist in medical diagnosis and reinforce the text-based answers.
  
- **Accurate Medical Insights:**  
  The system is built to deliver precise and detailed medical information by combining data-driven insights with expert heuristic models.

- **Jupyter Notebook Based Implementation:**  
  The project is implemented entirely in Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to experiment with and iterate on models interactively.

## Project Structure


## Requirements
Before running the project, please ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Essential Python libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch as needed)

You can install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VijayendraDwari/MultiAgent-MedQA.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MultiAgent-MedQA
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- **Launching the Notebooks:**  
  Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the implementation details of the Text QA and X-Ray Analysis agents.

- **Interacting with the Agents:**  
  The notebooks provide interactive examples to:
  - Ask text-based medical queries and retrieve answers from the Text QA Agent.
  - Load and process X-ray images with the X-Ray Analysis Agent to assist in diagnosis.
